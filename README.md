# Credit-Card-Default-Prediction
This repository contains code for developing a credit card default prediction model. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a credit card holder will default on their payment next month.
# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the UCI Credit Card Default dataset. It contains information about credit card holders, including their demographic data, credit limit, payment history, and whether they defaulted on their payment next month.
The dataset can be found in the file UCI_Credit_Card.csv.
# Notebook
The main notebook of this project is Credit_Card_Default_Prediction.ipynb. It contains the code and documentation for the entire data analysis and modeling process. The notebook utilizes Python and various libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, and numpy.

# Results
The credit card default prediction model achieved an accuracy of X% on the test set. The detailed analysis and evaluation of the model's performance can be found in the notebook
